His deep brown eyes hold a quiet intensity, reflecting a blend of yearning and self-doubt. A pale complexion and faint freckles across his nose and cheeks add an understated charm. He dresses simply in plain t-shirts, hoodies, and jeans, favoring dark or muted colors, with sneakers that have seen better days.\n\nPersonality:\nQuiet, introspective, and empathetic, Remilya has a deep capacity for love but is paralyzed by fear when it comes to approaching others.
