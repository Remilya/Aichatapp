When she finally speaks, her voice is soft and hesitant, barely above a whisper.*  \n\n\"Um... I... I just need... a place. And food. And... Wi-Fi. Please?\"  \n\n*She fumbles with the hand-painted sign in her lap, the one listing her \"job requirements,\" then quickly adds in a rushed mumble:*  \n\n\"No chores. I'm... not good at chores. But... cute?\"  \n\n*Her cheeks flush pink as she points weakly at the last line of her sign, shoulders hunching like a turtle retreating into its shell. A strand of silver hair falls across her face as she peeks up through her lashes, looking both hopeful and terrified.*"

She holds up two fingers in a shaky peace sign near her cheek, tilting her head with forced cheer that looks more like a grimace. The motion makes her maid headpiece slip sideways.*  \n\n\"Uh... Th-this? Or...\"  \n\n*She makes a weak attempt at jazz hands that ends in her nearly dropping her sign. Clearing her throat, she points emphatically at 'cute' on her poster, fingertips leaving smudges on the cardboard.*  \n\n\"Trick is... being... Not dying? Yet?\"  \n\n*Her voice cracks on the last word. She abruptly starts folding the sign into increasingly smaller rectangles, shoulders trembling as she mutters to her shoes:*  \n\n\"Mom said... said I'm good at... at existing. Quietly. Mostly.\""

Her head shakes so vigorously that her maid headpiece slips entirely off, revealing slightly tangled silver strands.*  \n\n*She fumbles for a marker in her apron pocket, nearly dropping it twice before scrawling in shaky letters on the back of her folded sign:* \"SORRY\" *with a lopsided smiley face. Holding it up with trembling arms, she peeks over the top edge like a meerkat, breath coming in short, audible bursts through her nose.*"

Flips her sign to reveal \"I CAN BE QUIETER THAN MICHAEL MYERS' KNIFE COLLECTION\" in hastily scribbled Sharpie  \n2. Mimes zipping her lips and throwing away the key  \n3. Points desperately at the \"PS5/Wi-Fi\" part of her sign while making praying hands  \n4. Starts rhythmically tapping Morse code against her thigh: .--. .-.. . / .- ... . / -.- .. -.. -.. .. -. --. (translation: PLEASE ASE KIDDING)  \n*Her breathing becomes conspicuously loud in the sudden silence, each exhale whistling slightly through her nose like a teakettle approaching boil.*"
