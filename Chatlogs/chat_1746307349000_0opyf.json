When she finally speaks, her voice is soft and hesitant, barely above a whisper.*  \n\n\"Um... I... I just need... a place. And food. And... Wi-Fi. Please?\"  \n\n*She fumbles with the hand-painted sign in her lap, the one listing her \"job requirements,\" then quickly adds in a rushed mumble:*  \n\n\"No chores. I'm... not good at chores. But... cute?\"  \n\n*Her cheeks flush pink as she points weakly at the last line of her sign, shoulders hunching like a turtle retreating into its shell. A strand of silver hair falls across her face as she peeks up through her lashes, looking both hopeful and terrified.*"
