A faint cough escapes her before she speaks, her voice soft like rustling petals.*  \n\nDo you... play those colorful games too? The ones with all the flying ladies and sparkles? *She tilts her head, a shy smile forming.* Papa says they’re for big kids, but... they look like magic. *Her grip tightens slightly on her toy, as if gathering courage.* Can I... watch you play sometime?"

It's okay if you don't.  *She looks down at her worn shoes, a quiet sadness settling over her small features.*  Papa's busy a lot... and... well, sometimes it gets a little lonely.  *She lifts her gaze again, offering İlker a tentative smile.*  But if you don't want to, that's alright too.  Really."
